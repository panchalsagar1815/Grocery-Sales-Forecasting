# Grocery-Sales-Forecasting

Sales forecasting has always been one of the most predominant applications of machine learning. Big companies like Walmart have been employing this technique to achieve steady and enormous growth for decades now. In this challenge, you as a data scientist must use machine learning to help a small grocery store in predicting its future sales and making better business decisions.

Given the daily sales of a grocery shop recorded for almost 2 years, your objective as a data scientist is to build a machine-learning model that can forecast the sales for the upcoming 3 months.

Project Title: Grocery Sales Forecasting

Project Description:
The "Grocery Sales Forecasting" project is a detailed analysis aimed at predicting future grocery sales based on historical data. The dataset comprises two essential features: date and grocery sales. To ensure the reliability of predictions, an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process was conducted, and the data was thoroughly cleaned.

Utilizing statistical methods and visualization techniques with Seaborn and Matplotlib, the project sought to gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality within the grocery sales data. This involved visualizing the distribution of sales over time, identifying potential outliers, and exploring any discernible patterns in daily or seasonal sales variations.

The core methodology involved the application of the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) regressor algorithm for sales forecasting. This machine learning approach was chosen for its ability to consider neighbouring data points when making predictions, making it particularly effective for time series forecasting.

By comparing forecasted sales with actual sales data, the project aimed to gather actionable insights into the accuracy and efficacy of the predictive model. The findings of this analysis can inform business decisions related to inventory management, staffing, and overall operational planning for grocery stores.

The "Grocery Sales Forecasting" project serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the retail industry, providing a data-driven approach to anticipate future sales trends and optimize business strategies for enhanced efficiency and profitability.
